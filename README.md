# Foodies Plan It!

## An app to assist in deciding and saving food plans for parties or get togethers

Users can login, choose an event date, and choose a course. Then, using the spoonacular API, users can search for recipes. They can then push up to 5 recipes to a "board", visible by all members of their party. Members vote on recipes making the decision process for home cooks much easier knowing what other members would prefer to eat. After all recipes have been voted on all members can see exactly what recipes will be created for each course and even save the shopping list pertinent to the recipe(s) they are responsible for.
